### IAM
---
##### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
```
IAM is a web service that allows for secure access to AWS resources. It is used to centrally manage who is authenticated 
and authorized to use resources.
```

##### IAM Properties & APIs
```
All IAM properties are listed here:
  * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_IAM.html
All IAM APIs are listed here: 
  * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/welcome.html
```

##### IAM Users
```
IAM users define permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. This identity is 
uniquely associated with one person, and can access resources via access keys (i.e. long term credentials). 
```

##### IAM Roles
```
IAM role is an identity that is assumable by anyone who needs it. These roles rely on temporary security credentials 
generated through STS to perform certain actions in AWS. Both roles and users can be attached with IAM policies that 
define the scope of permissions for individual roles.
```

##### Security Token Service (STS)
```
Entities with IAM roles attached will make an API request to the AWS STS endpoint for temporary security credentials, 
which are dynamically generated by STS when the request is made. Various STS API operations exist (e.g. AssumeRole,
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity) that can be found: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison
```

##### Trust Policy
```
Trust Policy
  * JSON document that define which principals are allowed to assume the role, and under what conditions.

Principal
  * Entity (e.g. IAM user) that can perform actions and access resources.
```

##### Federation
```
Federation
  * Creation of a trust relationship between an external identity provider and AWS. 
  * Trust relationships can be established via OIDC or SAML, which can be used to assign IAM roles to federated users.

Federated Users
   * Existing user identities outside AWS (e.g. IdPs) who can be granted temporary access to AWS resources.
