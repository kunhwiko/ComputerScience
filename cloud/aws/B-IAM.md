### IAM Basics
---
##### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
```
IAM is a web service that deals with secure access to AWS resources. It is used to centrally manage who is authenticated 
and authorized to use certain resources. Note that IAM resources are globally scoped in an AWS account.
```

##### IAM Properties & APIs
```
All IAM properties are listed here:
  * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_IAM.html

### IAM Users and Groups
---
##### IAM Users
```
IAM users have defined permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. This identity is 
uniquely associated with one person, and can access resources via access keys (i.e. long term credentials). 
```

##### IAM Group
```
a) When the number of IAM users increases, it becomes difficult to maintain permissions for each IAM user. To streamline 
   the process, users can be grouped into IAM groups so that permissions can be collectively granted. 
b) Groups can only consist of users. Users do not need to belong to a group, but can belong to multiple groups. When a
   user belongs to multiple groups, all policies from that group will be inherited to the user.
```

##### IAM Policy Types
```
Managed Policy
  * Standalone policy that is defined and maintained by AWS. These policies are predefined for convenience reasons.

Customer Managed Policy
  * Customers can define their own standalone policy and attach the newly defined policy to users, groups, and roles.
  
Inline Policy
  * Policy that is directly embedded into a single IAM identity. The policy maintains a strict one-to-one relationship 
    between a policy and an identity.   
```

### IAM Roles
---
##### IAM Role
```
IAM role is an identity that is assumable by anyone, including applications, who needs it. These roles rely on temporary 
security credentials generated through STS to perform certain actions in AWS. Like IAM users, roles can be attached with 
IAM policies that define the scope of permissions.
```

##### Security Token Service (STS)
```
Entities with IAM roles attached will make an API request to the AWS STS endpoint for temporary security credentials, 
which are dynamically generated by STS when the request is made. Various STS API operations exist (e.g. AssumeRole,
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity) that can be found: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison
```

##### Trust Policy
```
Trust Policy
  * JSON document that define which principals are allowed to assume the role, and under what conditions.

Principal
  * Entity (e.g. IAM user) that can perform actions and access resources.
```

##### Federation
```
Federation
  * Creation of a trust relationship between an external identity provider and AWS. 
  * Trust relationships can be established via OIDC or SAML, which can be used to assign IAM roles to federated users.

Federated Users
   * Existing user identities outside AWS (e.g. IdPs) who can be granted temporary access to AWS resources.
