##### Service Mesh
```
a) Service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that allows for adding capabilities like observability, traffic 
   management (e.g. rate limiting), and security (e.g. access control, authentication, encryption) without adding them 
   to application code. 
b) Service meshes typically consist of the control plane (e.g. controller) and data plane (e.g. sidecar containers).
