### Networking
---
##### Netfilter
```
a) Netfilter is a Linux network framework for packet filtering, NAT creation, and packet modification.
b) Netfilter represents a set of hooks in the Linux kernel. As packets traverse the network stack of the kernel, they 
   will traverse through individual hooks.
c) Netfilter allows users to write modules and register callback functions to individual hooks. When hooks are triggered, 
   callback functions will be triggered. 
```

##### Netfilter Hooks
```
NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING
  * Triggered by incoming traffic soon after entering the network stack.
  * Triggered before any routing decisions are made.

NF_IP_LOCAL_IN
  * Triggered for packets that are destined for the current host.

NF_IP_FORWARD
  * Triggered for packets that need to be forwarded.

NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT
  * Triggered for outbound traffic generated by the current host.

NF_IP_POST_ROUTING
  * Triggered for outgoing traffic after routing but before being sent out on the wire.
```

##### IPTable
```
a) IPtables are firewall tools that interact with kernel hooks from the Netfilter framework.
b) IPtables are organized in the following hierarchy:
     * Tables : Files that join similar action and consist of multiple chains.
     * Chains : Chains are a list of rules.
     * Rules  : Statements that instruct the system what to do with a packet.  
```

##### Tables of IP Table
```
Filter Table
  * This table is used to decide whether to accept or deny a packet to its intended destination. Examples of chains in 
    this table are input, output, and forward chains.

NAT Table
  * This table is used to implement NAT rules.
  * This table is used to determine whether and how to modify the packet's source and destination addresses. Examples of 
    chains in this table are prerouting chains for DNAT and postrouting chains for SNAT.

Mangle Table
  * This table is used to alter the IP headers of packets (e.g. TTL values, number of network hops to sustain etc.).

Raw Table
  * IPtable is a stateful firewall that inspects packets in relation to previous packets through connection tracking.
    This table is used to exempt packets from connection tracking or allow users to work with packets before state is 
    tracked.

Security Table
  * This table is used to set SELinux security context onto packets.
```

##### Connection Tracking (Conntrack)
```
Conntrack is a feature from Netfilter that enables iptables to view packets as part of an ongoing session. 
```

##### IPSet
```
IPset is an extension of iptables that allows for the creation of firewall rules that matches on entire sets of addresses 
at once. Lookup time for addresses saved in ipsets is O(1).  
```

##### IP Virtual Server (IPVS)
```
a) IPVS running on a host acts as a transport layer load balancer in the Linux kernel.
   This load balancer can direct requests for TCP/UDP based services to a cluster of real servers.
   The machine that is configured as the load balancer is known as a "Director".
b) IPVS supports various load balancing algorithms (e.g. round robin, shortest expected delay, src/dest hashing).
c) IPVS can make services of the real servers to appear as a virtual service on a single IP address.
```

##### IPVS Networking
```
Step 1) Client sends a packet with the destination IP address being the virtual IP address of the Director.
Step 2) Director will change the destination of the packet to one of the backend servers.
        The packet's source IP here also needs to be rewritten to be the Director's actual IP address.
        SNAT or masquerading has to be configured beforehand to accomplish this as IPVS only supports DNAT.
Step 3) Backend server will send a response back with the destination IP address being the Director's actual IP address.
Step 4) Director will send a response back to the client with the source IP address being the virtual IP address of the Director.
        Again, SNAT or masquerading has to be configured beforehand.
```
