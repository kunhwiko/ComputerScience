### Base Concepts
---
##### Operating System (OS)
```
a) OS is a software system that helps to manage and facilitate hardware resources and execution of user programs.
b) OS may also provide a high level interface to help users to interact with the computer system. 
c) OS typically provides the following functionality:
     * process management : scheduling tasks, concurrency handling, executing applications
     * memory management  : memory allocation, file system management
     * device management  : I/O management, hardware management
     * security           : network, security, and access control
```

##### Kernel
```
a) Kernel is a core component of the OS that provides low level services to manage and communicate with computer hardware.
b) Kernel provides functionality such as memory management, process scheduling, device driver management, and system call handling.
```

##### Shell
```
User interface to interact with kernel.
```

##### Driver
```
Drivers represent code that runs in the kernel to communicate with hardware devices.
```

##### Module
```
Modules represent code that can extend the behavior of the kernel and be removed on demand.
