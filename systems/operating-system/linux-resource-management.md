### Resource Allocation
---
##### Control Group (cgroup)
```
Linux kernel feature that limits, isolates, and monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O, network) of a collection of processes.
```

##### Namespace
```
Linux kernel feature that creates a virtual instance of a resource for a process or group of processes isolated from the host system.
Namespaces allow for the isolation of process runtimes, network stack, file system, and UID/GID assignment.
